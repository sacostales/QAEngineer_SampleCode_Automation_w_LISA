# QAEngineer_SampleCode_Automation_w_LISA

For Step by Step Description of the Procedure please see the README.docx file 

Description:
The sample code contains an automation project using ca Dev Test Solutions Automation Framework (LISA), as well as code for building a REST service that the .lisa project will use as an endpoint to demonstrate running automated test cases to call and validate the behavior of an API. Note: public API https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all 

Requirements:
ca technologies DevTest Solutions https://docops.ca.com/devtest-solutions/9-1/en/installing 

Objectives:
1.	Call a REST service api using GET method (can also do POST, PUT, DELETE)
2.	Create/Add Assertions for validating request-response 
	Note: This can be done using the softwares UI or custom scripts
3.	Create filters to parse through the response and capture desired data
4.	Create a delimited file for testers to add different parameters and/or headers to loop through and make variety of calls to the service for both positive and negative test cases
5.	Output log message to verify to the user that the service is behaving as expected
